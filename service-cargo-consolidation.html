<h1>Cargo consolidation</h1>
<p>Reception of goods from various Chinese suppliers at our warehouse in Xi'an.</p>
<p>There are different ways to ship goods from China. All of them differ in cost, terms of execution and terms of delivery.</p>
<p>Sometimes the delivery of one small-sized cargo is not rational and it is more profitable to combine several orders from different suppliers or separated by the time of receipt into one delivery</p>
<p>We will help to combine several small-sized cargoes from one or several suppliers in one place (warehouse), temporarily store cargoes up to the optimal delivery volume and send them along a pre-planned route.</p>
<p>Upon acceptance of the goods to the warehouse, we can check its quality according to the requirements of the customer, this will reduce the cost of returning low-quality goods from another country.</p>
<p>Our warehouse in the bonded area can be used for goods that have passed customs clearance.</p>
<p>We can provide the service of technical export of cargo arriving at our regular warehouse - to buy products from the customer's suppliers.</p>
<p>We ship cargo by air, railway, sea and road transport.</p>
<p>The cost of consolidation depends on many components, the cost is calculated after receiving full information about the cargo, quantity, regularity of delivery.</p>
