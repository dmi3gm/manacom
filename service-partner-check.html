<h1>Reliability Check</h1>
<p>Verification of a foreign counterparty is a mandatory step in the preparation of an international transaction.</p>
<p> When concluding contracts with foreign counterparties, additional risks arise:</p>
<ul>
<li>such a counterparty is more difficult to hold liable for failure to fulfill obligations</li>
<li>the litigation will be more costly, especially if you have to conduct a dispute in a foreign court</li>
<li>various methods of doing business​</li>
</ul>

<p>If the counterparty turns out to be dishonest or a member of the sanctions lists, the company will suffer significant losses.</p>

<h2>What we do:</h2>

<p>We receive information from paid and open sources in China and Russia, we form a certificate in the language of the customer. We give explanations on the content and focus on potential risks. The cost of preparing such information is 1000&nbspCNY.</p>

<p>Offline verification of a potential counterparty with a visit to the office or production costs 3500&nbspCNY + travel expenses.</p>
